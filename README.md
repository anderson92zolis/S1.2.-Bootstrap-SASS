## Level 1

### Task 1

* In this exercise we will begin with the main part, which is the contingut that users see when entering the website: [Landing page](https://github.com/anderson92zolis/S1.2.-Bootstrap-SASS/blob/main/Recursos%20projecte%20sprint%201.2/Dise%C3%B1o/desktop-active-states.jpg)

#### NavBar Implementation

   * To enhance user navigation, we will incorporate a fixed top navigation bar. We'll achieve this by utilizing the Bootstrap **"navBar" component.**

#### Grid system

   * The main content of the landing page will be organized using Bootstrap's responsive grid system. This approach ensures a seamless user experience across different devices. Specifically, we'll divide the screen into two columns. On the left, you'll find the slogan, description, and buttons, while the image will be displayed on the right.

#### Minimum Requirements

   To meet the project specifications, please follow these minimum requirements:
   
   1. **Bootstrap Installation:**
      - Install Bootstrap within the project. Avoid using CDN (Content Delivery Network) and opt for local installation.
   
   2. **NavBar Implementation:**
      - Utilize the Bootstrap NavBar component for the top navigation bar.
   
   3. **Responsive Grid Design:**
      - Implement Bootstrap's responsive grid system to ensure optimal display on tablets and mobile devices.
   
   4. **SASS Styling:**
      - Customize the primary and secondary colors of Bootstrap using SASS. Create an "main.scss" file to manage these customizations.
   
   5. **Color Variables:**
      - Define the following color variables in your SASS file for button colors:
         - Primary Color: #5265E1
         - Secondary Color: #FA5959

### Task 2: Product Features

   Now, let's move on to creating the product features section [Feature](https://github.com/anderson92zolis/S1.2.-Bootstrap-SASS/blob/main/Recursos%20projecte%20sprint%201.2/Dise%C3%B1o/desktop-active-states.jpg)

* #### Minimum Requirements

   For the product features section, ensure the following minimum requirements are met:
   
   - The "Features" section with descriptive text should be placed within the Bootstrap Grid.
   - Utilize the Bootstrap Tabs component, customizing its styles to align with our website.

### Task 3: Product Section

* #### As the cards in the image are very different from Bootstrap cards, in this exercise we give you the possibility of either customising Bootstrap cards or creating your own classes to layout them.

   * Minimum requirements:
   
   - Responsive.
   - Bootstrap buttons in the primary colour defined in **exercise 1**.
